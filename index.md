# Introduction

Pimacs is an Emacs client for [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev/). It
provides an interactive interface to the Pi Coding Agent directly from
Emacs.

# Setup

## Install the Pi Agent

First, install the Pi agent using npm:

    npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent

Pimacs does not yet support authentication configuration. To configure
your provider, run `pi` in a terminal, then run `/login` in Pi.

## Install `pimacs.el`

Pimacs is available from [MELPA Stable](https://stable.melpa.org/),
which is recommended for installation. Add it to your package archives,
then install with `use-package`:

    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

    (use-package pimacs
      :ensure t)

# Doctor

Run `M-x pimacs-doctor` to display a dependency report. It checks that
Pi is available and meets the minimum supported version, and that
Tree-sitter and the Markdown grammars are installed. When Pi or either
grammar is missing, the report provides a button to install it.

# Usage

Run `M-x pimacs-chat` from any file in your project to start a Pimacs
chat. With a prefix argument (`C-u M-x pimacs-chat`), open a transient
to set a session name and root directory. Setting a root directory
starts the chat there instead of using `project.el` to find the project
root. Run `M-x pimacs-switch-chat` to switch between active chats.

The chat buffer is read-only except for the prompt input area. Use `RET`
to submit a prompt and `C-j` to insert a newline. Press `i` from
anywhere in the chat buffer to move point to the prompt input area.

## Slash Commands

[Slash commands](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/usage#slash-commands)
support completion in the prompt buffer. Type `/` and press `C-M-i` (or
any key bound to completion) to see available commands.

In addition to the commands listed below, extension commands, prompt
templates, and skills registered with the Pi agent can also be invoked
via slash commands. These are fetched automatically from the agent and
included in the completion list.

Angle brackets `<>` denote required arguments, square brackets `[]`
denote optional arguments.

## File Name Completion

Type `@` followed by a partial file path to trigger file name completion
in the prompt buffer. The completion backend is controlled by
`pimacs-file-completion-backend`.

## Bash

Prefix a command with `!` to run it in Bash. Use `!!` to run a command
without adding it to the conversation context.

    ! echo "hello"

## Sending Context

You can send contextual information from any buffer to the Pimacs chat
prompt.

| Command                       | Description                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pimacs-send-region`          | Append the selected region to the prompt input.                                                                                       |
| `pimacs-send-filename`        | Append the current buffer’s filename (prefixed with `@`) to the prompt input.                                                         |
| `pimacs-send-flycheck-errors` | Append the Flycheck errors at point to the prompt input. Falls back to all current errors in the buffer when there are none at point. |

## Images

You can attach images to your prompt to provide visual context to the
agent. Images are displayed as thumbnail previews above the prompt input
area and are sent along with your message. The agent may also render
images inline in its responses, for example when using the `read` tool
on a file that contains images.

### Supported Formats

The following image formats are supported:

- PNG

- JPEG

- GIF

- WebP

Drag an image file from your file manager and drop it into the Pimacs
chat buffer, or paste a supported image from the clipboard via
`yank-media`. To remove an attached image, click on the thumbnail with
the mouse, or place point on it and press `backspace` or `delete`.

## State Lines

The header line displays session context and model information. The mode
line displays the current agent state. Customize them with the
`pimacs-header-line-format` and `pimacs-mode-line-format` defcustoms.
Both accept strings and state components; use `:spacer` to right-align
following components.

    (setq pimacs-header-line-format
          '(:context_usage :spacer
            (:model face font-lock-function-name-face)))

See `pimacs-header-line-format` for available components. A component
may also be a function that receives the current state plist.

Extension status text can be placed in either state line with a
`(:status STATUS-KEY ...)` component. STATUS-KEY is the key used by the
extension’s status update. Text properties after the key customize the
status at that placement.

    (setq pimacs-header-line-format
          '(:context_usage " " (:status "xyz-status" face font-lock-warning-face)
            :spacer :model))

By default, status text also appears beside the prompt. To display a
status only in a state line, add its key to
`pimacs-status-widget-hidden-keys`.

    (setq pimacs-status-widget-hidden-keys '("xyz-status"))

## Managing Chats

Use `pimacs-switch-chat` to switch between active Pimacs chats using
completion. Use `pimacs-list-chats` to display all active chats in a
sortable tabulated list. Press `RET` to visit the chat on the current
line and `g` to refresh the list. Select a column header to sort by that
column.

Customize the list’s columns and initial sort order with
`pimacs-list-chats-table` and `pimacs-list-chats-sort-key`.

## Searching and Resuming Sessions

Use `M-x pimacs-resume` to return to a persisted Pi session. From an
active chat, the command lists recent sessions from that chat’s project
session directory and switches the current chat to the selected session.

When no active chat exists, `M-x pimacs-resume` lists sessions from the
current project’s session directory and creates a new chat rooted at the
selected session’s recorded working directory. Invoke
`C-u M-x pimacs-resume` to search all projects under
`pimacs-session-directory` instead.

Candidates show the session name or identifier, modification date,
preview, and project directory where available. The session directory
root is controlled by `pimacs-session-directory`; its default is Pi’s
shared `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` directory. Standalone resume reads
session metadata directly and does not require the `rg` or `jq`
executables used by historical session search.

Use `pimacs-search-sessions` to search historical Pi sessions. The
command opens a search buffer and accepts the initial query
interactively. Searches use `rg` and `jq`; run `M-x pimacs-doctor` to
check that both executables are available.

The search buffer provides controls for the search type, case
sensitivity, context lines, project scope, and content types. Results
are rendered as they arrive and grouped by session. Press `RET` on a
result to resume that session, or `g` to refresh the search. Standard
section navigation and visibility commands are also available in the
search buffer.

## Section Visibility

Pimacs represents the chat as a hierarchy of sections. Every non-root
section has a type, a visibility state, and may have a parent or
children. Put point in a section and run `M-x pimacs-describe-section`
to open a Help buffer with these details. The report shows the section’s
`type`, visibility and user override state, automatic-hiding
eligibility, applied face, buffer positions, and metadata. Parent and
child section types are links; use `RET` to follow them. The `type`
value is the symbol to use when configuring section faces or automatic
hiding, such as `tool-call`.

Use `TAB` or `C-i` to toggle the section at point. Hiding a section
keeps its first line visible, so it can be shown again. On graphical
displays, the fringe indicator can also be selected with the mouse to
toggle visibility. Use `S-TAB` to cycle the visibility of the entire
chat, or `1`, `2`, and `3` to show progressively more of the tree around
point. `M-1`, `M-2`, and `M-3` do the same for every top-level section.
See [Keybindings](#Keybindings) for the complete list of visibility and
navigation commands.

As a conversation grows, Pimacs automatically hides older top-level
sections. `pimacs-section-autohide-count` sets how many eligible recent
sections remain visible; its default is 2, and `nil` disables automatic
hiding. Use `pimacs-section-autohide-filter` to select the eligible
section types. For example, the following keeps four eligible sections
visible while never automatically hiding user sections:

    (setq pimacs-section-autohide-count 4
          pimacs-section-autohide-filter '(:exclude user))

Automatic hiding does not override a section whose visibility you
explicitly toggled with `TAB` or `C-i`. Set
`pimacs-section-visibility-indicators` to `nil` to disable the fringe
indicators.

# UI Customization

Pimacs renders the chat as a sequence of sections. Each section type has
a face, so the chat can be styled without changing the Markdown
renderer. Customize `pimacs-section-type-faces` to select the face for a
section type, and customize the selected face with `M-x customize-face`.

The built-in section faces are listed in [Custom Faces](#Custom-Faces).

## Common Styling Effects

A section face supplies the base appearance for one kind of chat
content. Only the attributes that you set take effect; leave an
attribute unspecified when the Markdown or role styling should continue
to provide it.

For a coloured assistant card that preserves Markdown colours, set only
a background and `:extend t`:

    (set-face-attribute 'pimacs-section-assistant-face nil
                        :background "#18212b"
                        :extend t)

Set `:foreground` when every part of a section should use one colour.
Otherwise, leave it as `unspecified` to retain Markdown heading, link,
and syntax colours. Likewise, set `:height` or `:slant` to make a
section compact or italic, and leave `:weight` unspecified when Markdown
bold text should remain bold.

Role labels such as `assistant>` and tool names retain their own
recognizable colours by default. Configure their faces separately when
you want to change them.

## Cards and Padding

Section faces are also applied to `pimacs-section-padding`. Specify both
`:background` and `:extend t` for a full-width card background; the
background then also covers empty padding lines.

Thinking defaults to `shadow`. A compact, more subdued thinking card can
be configured as follows:

    (set-face-attribute 'pimacs-section-thinking-face nil
                        :foreground "#64707c"
                        :background "#131a21"
                        :height 0.9
                        :extend t)

## Choosing Section Faces

The type-to-face mapping is evaluated when a section is created. Change
one entry without replacing the other defaults with `alist-get`:

    (setf (alist-get 'tool-result pimacs-section-type-faces)
          'my-pimacs-tool-result-face)

Define a named face when several attributes belong together:

    (defface my-pimacs-tool-result-face
      '((t :inherit fixed-pitch
           :foreground "#c2cbd5"
           :background "#1a2027"
           :extend t))
      "My Pimacs tool result face.")

Changing a face updates already-displayed text immediately. Changing
`pimacs-section-type-faces` affects newly created sections; recreate the
chat contents to apply a new mapping to existing sections.

## Prompt Face

The editable portion of the prompt uses `pimacs-prompt-face` and can be
customized independently:

    (set-face-attribute 'pimacs-prompt-face nil
                        :foreground "#d7e0e8"
                        :background "#202936"
                        :extend t)

The `user>` prompt label uses `pimacs-chat-user-role-face`.

# Sandbox

To run Pi inside a sandbox, customize `pimacs-executable` and
`pimacs-flags`:

    (setq pimacs-executable "nono")
    (setq pimacs-flags '("run" "--silent" "--profile" "pi" "--allow-cwd" "--" "pi"
                     "--tools" "read,bash,edit,write,grep,find,ls"))

# How It Works

Emacs starts Pi in [RPC mode](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/rpc). In this
setup, Pi handles the agent logic while Emacs provides the user
interface. Some features, such as `/login` and `/logout`, are not
[supported](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/885) because
they are not currently exposed through the RPC API.

## Extension UI

Pimacs supports the RPC-compatible extension UI methods: notifications,
selection, confirmation, text input, editing text in an Emacs buffer,
setting the prompt text and chat title, prompt widgets, and status text.
Extension commands, tools, hooks, and custom messages are also
supported.

Pimacs does not support terminal-specific extension UI features,
including `ctx.ui.custom()` components, component factories, extension
keyboard shortcuts, or custom TUI rendering callbacks. Extensions should
use the supported UI methods when running in RPC mode. See the [Pi
extension documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions) for the
full extension API.
